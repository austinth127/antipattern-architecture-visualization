                        Microservice architecture is the mainstream direction

                        Microservice architecture is an approach to software
                        development in which software is composed of small,
                        independent services that communicate in a defined
                        manner. Each of these services are then owned and
                        managed by small, self-contained teams.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Implementing a microservice architecture can offer a
                        number of benifits over monolithic architecture{" "}

                        architectures that are properly developed to avoid bad
